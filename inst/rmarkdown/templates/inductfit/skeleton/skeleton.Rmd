# Induction models available -- CHANGE THE TEXT BELOW AS NEEDED 

Four induction models (Equations 1, 2, 3, and 4) were fit to the *in vitro* induction data. 

*Equation 1. E~max~ model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = 1 + \frac{E_{max} \times I}{EC_{50} + I} $$ 

where I is the concentration of the inducer, E~max~ is the maximum change in fold induction, and EC~50~ is the concentration of the inducer that elicits half the maximum fold-change in induction. 

*Equation 2. E~max~ slope model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = 1 + E_{max} \times \frac{I^n}{EC_{50}^n + I^n} $$

where I is the concentration of the inducer, E~max~ is the maximum change in fold induction, EC~50~ is the concentration of the inducer that elicits half the maximum fold-change in induction, and n is the Hill equation coefficient describing the slope. 

*Equation 3. Slope model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = 1 + I \times n $$

where I is the concentration of the inducer and n is the slope. 

*Equation 4. Sigmoidal three-parameter model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = \frac{Ind_{max}}{1 + e^{ \frac{IndC_{50}-I}{n}}} $$

where I is the concentration of the inducer, Ind~max~ is the maximum fold induction, IndC~50~ is the concentration of the inducer that elicits half the maximum fold induction, and n is the Hill equation coefficient describing the slope.
