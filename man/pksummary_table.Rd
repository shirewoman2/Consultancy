\arguments{
\item{sim_data_file}{a simulator output file. If you supplied a file name in
a data.frame of observed PK or a csv or Excel file of observed PK for
\code{observed_PK}, that file name will be used preferentially and you can
leave this blank. Similarly, if you supply a filled-out report input form
to the argument \code{report_input_file}, the file name you supplied
\emph{there} will be used preferentially, and you can leave this blank.}

\item{PKparameters}{(optional) the PK parameters to include as a character
  vector. \itemize{

  \item{By default, if you have a single-dose simulation, the parameters will
  include AUC and Cmax for dose 1, and, if you have a multiple-dose
  simulation, AUC and Cmax for the last dose. Also by default, if you have an
  effector present, the parameters will include the AUC and Cmax values with
  and without the effector as well as those ratios.}

  \item{Alternatively, you can specify a vector of any combination of
  specific, individual parameters, e.g., \code{c("Cmax_dose1",
  "AUCtau_last").} Be sure to encapsulate the parameters you want with
  \code{c(...)}! To see the full set of possible parameters to extract, enter
  \code{view(PKParameterDefinitions)} into the console.}

  \item{If you supply observed data using either the argument
  \code{report_input_file} or the argument \code{observed_PK}, the only PK
  parameters that will be included are those available for the observed
  data.}

  \item{Parameters that don't make sense for your scenario -- such as asking
  for \code{AUCinf_dose1_withInhib} when your simulation did not include an
  inhibitor or effector -- will not be included.}

  \item{tmax will be listed as median, min, and max rather than mean, lower
  and higher X\% confidence interval or X percentiles. Similarly, if you
  request trial means, the values for tmax will be the range of medians for
  the trials rather than the range of means.}}

  An example of acceptable input here: \code{PKparameters = c("AUCtau_last",
  "AUCtau_last_withInhib", "Cmax_last", "Cmax_last_withInhib",
  "AUCtau_ratio_last", "Cmax_ratio_last")}.}

\item{PKorder}{Would you like the order of the PK parameters to be the the
order specified in the Consultancy Report Template (default), or would you
like the order to match the order you specified with the argument
\code{PKparameters}? Options are "default" or "user specified".}

\item{sheet_PKparameters}{(optional) If you want the PK parameters to be
pulled from a specific tab in the simulator output file, list that tab
here. Most of the time, this should be left as NA.}

\item{observed_PK}{(optional) If you have a data.frame, a named numeric
vector, or an Excel or csv file with observed PK parameters, supply the
full file name in quotes or the data.frame or vector here, and the
simulated-to-observed mean ratios will be calculated. If you supply an
Excel file, it should have only one tab. We prefer supplying csv files here
since they're faster to read in anyway. The supplied data.frame or file
must include columns for each of the PK parameters you would like to
compare, and those column names \emph{must} be among the PK parameter
options listed in \code{PKParameterDefinitions}. If you would like the
output table to include the observed data CV for any of the parameters, add
"_CV" to the end of the parameter name, e.g., "AUCinf_dose1_CV". Please see
the "Example" section of this help file for examples of how to set this up.}

\item{report_input_file}{(optional) This argument is an alternative way to
specify both what simulator Excel file to use and also what the observed PK
parameters were. Input is the name of the Excel file created by running
\code{\link{generateReportInputForm}}, which you have now filled out,
including the path if it's in any other directory than the current one.
Please see the "Details" section at the bottom for more information on this
option.}

\item{sheet_report}{the sheet in the Excel report file that contains
information about the study, e.g., "study info - DDI" or "study info - no
DDI" if you haven't renamed the tab. This only applies if you have supplied
an Excel file name for \code{report_input_file}. If you're supplying a
simulator output Excel file for \code{sim_data_file}, ignore this.}

\item{mean_type}{What kind of means and CVs do you want listed in the output
table? Options are "arithmetic" or "geometric" (default). If you supplied a
report input form, only specify this if you'd like to override the value
listed there.}

\item{tissue}{For which tissue would you like the PK parameters to be pulled?
Options are "plasma" (default) or "blood" (possible but not as thoroughly
tested).}

\item{includeCV}{TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to include rows for CV
in the table}

\item{includeConfInt}{TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to include whatever
confidence intervals were included in the simulator output file. Note that
the confidence intervals are geometric since that's what the simulator
outputs (see an AUC tab and the summary statistics; these values are the
ones for, e.g., "90\% confidence interval around the geometric mean(lower
limit)").}

\item{includeRange}{TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include the
minimum and maximum values}

\item{includePerc}{TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include 5th to 95th
percentiles}

\item{includeTrialMeans}{TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include the
range of trial means for a given parameter. Note: This is calculated from
individual values rather than being pulled directly from the output.}

\item{concatVariability}{TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to concatenate
the variability. If "TRUE", the output will be formatted into a single row
and listed as the lower confidence interval or percentile to the upper CI
or percentile, e.g., "2400 to 2700". Please note that the current
SimcypConsultancy template lists one row for each of the upper and lower
values, so this should be set to FALSE for official reports.}

\item{adjust_conc_units}{Would you like to adjust the units to something
other than what was used in the simulation? Default is NA to leave the
units as is, but if you set the concentration units to something else, this
will attempt to adjust the units to match that. This only adjusts AUC and
<<<<<<< HEAD
Cmax values at present and, if you're switching between mass per volume and
mole per volume units, it will assume you want to use the MW of the
substrate to do that.}
=======
Cmax values at present.}
>>>>>>> master

\item{prettify_columns}{TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to make easily
human-readable column names. TRUE makes pretty column names such as "AUCinf
(h*ng/mL)" whereas FALSE leaves the column with the R-friendly name from
\code{\link{extractPK}}, e.g., "AUCinf_dose1".}

\item{prettify_compound_names}{TRUE (default) or FALSE on whether to make
compound names prettier in the prettified column titles and in any Word
output files. This was designed for simulations where the substrate and any
metabolites, effectors, or effector metabolites are among the standard
options for the simulator, and leaving \code{prettify_compound_names =
TRUE} will make the name of those compounds something more human readable.
For example, "SV-Rifampicin-MD" will become "rifampicin", and
"Sim-Midazolam" will become "midazolam". Set each compound to the name
you'd prefer to see in your column titles if you would like something
different. For example, \code{prettify_compound_names = c("effector" =
"teeswiftavir", "substrate" = "superstatin")}. Please note that "effector"
includes \emph{all} the effectors and effector metabolites present, so, if
you're setting the effector name, you really should use something like this
if you're including effector metabolites: \code{prettify_compound_names =
c("effector" = "teeswiftavir and 1-OH-teeswiftavir", "substrate" =
"superstatin")}.}

\item{checkDataSource}{TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to include in the
output a data.frame that lists exactly where the data were pulled from the
simulator output file. Useful for QCing.}

\item{save_table}{optionally save the output table and, if requested, the QC
info, by supplying a file name in quotes here, e.g., "My nicely formatted
table.docx" or "My table.csv", depending on whether you'd prefer to have
the main PK table saved as a Word or csv file. If you supply only the file
extension, e.g., \code{save_table = "docx"}, the name of the file will be
the file name plus "PK summary table" with that extension and output will
be located in the same folder as \code{sim_data_file}. If you supply
something other than just "docx" or just "csv" for the file name but you
leave off the file extension, we'll assume you want it to be ".csv". While
the main PK table data will be in whatever file format you requested, if
you set \code{checkDataSource = TRUE}, the QC data will be in a csv file on
its own and will have "- QC" added to the end of the file name.
\strong{WARNING:} SAVING TO WORD DOES NOT WORK ON SHAREPOINT. This is a
Microsoft permissions issue, not an R issue. If you try to save on
SharePoint, you will get a warning that R will save your file to your
Documents folder instead.}

\item{fontsize}{the numeric font size for Word output. Default is 11 point.
This only applies when you save the table as a Word file.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame of PK summary data and, if observed data were
  provided, simulated-to-observed ratios. If \code{checkDataSource = TRUE},
  output will instead be a list of that data.frame (named "Table") and
  information on where the values came from for QCing (named "QC").
}
\description{
\code{pksummary_table} creates tables of PK parameters for reports and
presentations, including reporting means, CVs, and confidence intervals or
percentiles and, optionally, comparisons to observed data. This function
automatically finds the correct tab and the correct cells in a Simulator
output Excel file to obtain those data. \strong{Notes:} \itemize{\item{Please
see the notes at the bottom of this help file for how to supply observed data
in a standardized fashion that this function can read.} \item{If you would
like to make a single PK table for multiple files at once, please see the

function \code{\link{pksummary_mult}}.} \item{All parameters are for the
\emph{substrate} unless you specify that you would like the PK parameters to
be pulled from a specific tab in the Excel output file that is for some other
compound.} \item{ If the simulator output Excel file lives on SharePoint,
you'll need to close it or this function will just keep running and not
generate any output while it waits for access to the file.}}

\details{
Because we need to have a standardized way to input observed data, setting up
the input for this function requires creating a data.frame or named vector of
the observed PK data, supplying a csv or Excel file with observed PK data, or
filling out an Excel form.

\strong{OPTION A: Supply a data.frame or a named vector.} If you supply a
data.frame, the column names will indicate which PK parameter you want, and
if you supply a named numeric vector, the names of the vector will perform
the same function. If you have CV values for any observed data that you'd
like to include in the table, make the name be the PK parameter with a suffix
of "_CV".

An example of specifying a data.frame: \code{observed_PK =
data.frame(AUCinf_dose1 = 60, AUCinf_dose1_CV = 0.38, Cmax_dose1 = 22,
Cmax_dose1_CV = 0.24)}

An example of specifying a named vector: \code{observed_PK = c("AUCinf_dose1"
= 60, "AUCinf_dose1_CV" = 0.38, "Cmax_dose1" = 22, "Cmax_dose1_CV" = 0.24)}.

\strong{OPTION B: Use an Excel or csv file of oserved PK data.} In Excel,
create a single-tab Excel file or a csv file where the 1st row lists the
names of the PK parameters and the 2nd row lists the values. Just as with
Option A, you can include observed CV values by adding "_CV" to the parameter
name. To see an example of how this should look, run this in the console and
then open the csv file:

\code{write.csv(data.frame(AUCinf_dose1 = 60, AUCinf_dose1_CV = 0.38,
Cmax_dose1 = 22, Cmax_dose1_CV = 0.24), file = "Example observed PK
values.csv", row.names = FALSE)}

When you call on \code{pksummary_table}, use the following syntax,
substituting your file name for the example: \code{observed_PK = "Example
observed PK values.csv"}

\strong{OPTION C: Fill out an Excel form.} Here are the steps to take for
this option: \enumerate{

\item{Use the function \code{\link{generateReportInputForm}} to create an
Excel file where you can enter information about your project. Example:
\code{generateReportInputForm("My report input form.xlsx")}}

\item{Go to the tab "study info - DDI" or "study info - no DDI", whichever is
appropriate for your situation. Under the heading "Simulated data", enter the
name of the specific simulator output Excel file you want to compare.}

\item{Under the heading "Observed data" on that same tab, enter details about
your observed data. It's ok if you don't have all the information; anything
that's missing won't be included in the final S/O table. It's also ok to
rename this tab or make copies of it within the same Excel file for making
other S/O tables.}

\item{Save the report input form.}

\item{Back in RStudio, run this function using the file name of that Excel
report form as input for \code{report_input_file} and the name of the "study
info - DDI/no DDI" tab as the input for \code{sheet_report}. Note: If the
Excel file lives on SharePoint, you'll need to close it or this function will
just keep running and not generate any output while it waits for access to
the file.} }

                                         Cmax_dose1_CV = 0.24))

# Or you can supply a named numeric vector:
pksummary_table(sim_data_file = "My simulated data.xlsx",
                observed_PK = c("AUCinf_dose1" = 60,
                                "AUCinf_dose1_CV" = 0.38,

                                "Cmax_dose1_CV" = 0.24))

# Or an Excel or csv file:
pksummary_table(sim_data_file = "mdz-5mg-sd.xlsx",
                observed_PK = "mdz observed PK.csv")
