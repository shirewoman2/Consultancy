#' Overlay multiple data sets onto a single concentration-time graph
#'
#' \code{ct_plot_overlay} is meant to be used in conjunction with
#' \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}} to create single graphs with overlaid
#' concentration-time data for multiple tissues, compounds, or Simcyp Simulator
#' output files for easy comparisons. \emph{Note:} There are some nuances to
#' overlaying observed data. Please see the "Details" section at the bottom of
#' this help file. For detailed instructions and examples, please see the
#' SharePoint file "Simcyp PBPKConsult R Files - Simcyp PBPKConsult R
#' Files/SimcypConsultancy function examples and instructions/Concentration-time
#' plots 3 - overlaying plots/Concentration-time-plot-examples-3.docx". (Sorry,
#' we are unable to include a link to it here.)
#'
#' \strong{Notes on including observed data:} We recently added the option of
#' including observed data and are in the process of testing this. To include
#' observed data, you have two options: \enumerate{
#'
#' \item{Use the Simulator Excel PE data entry template to save your observed
#' data. Then, when you run \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}}, supply the names
#' of those Excel files to the observed data  function argument. This is the
#' BEST option because it contains the most information about the observed
#' data.}
#'
#' \item{Include observed data in your simulation files. Those data will be
#' automatically extracted when you run \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}} if
#' "obs_data_files" is left as the default NA. The drawback to this approach is
#' that it's not clear whether there was an inhibitor present, for example, or
#' which compound the data describe.} }
#'
#' The \code{ct_plot_overlay} function will automatically figure out which
#' observed data should be compared with which simulated compound IDs, tissues,
#' etc. However, because the function doesn't know which simulator \emph{file}
#' goes with which observed data, it will assume that \emph{all} the observed
#' data are appropriate to compare to \emph{all} the files included in
#' \code{ct_dataframe} by default. If that's not the case, after you use
#' \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}} to extract your data, you can indicate
#' which simulator output file goes with which observed file by setting the
#' simulator output file in the column "File". This admittedly requires a bit of
#' R knowledge, so please ask a member of the R Working Group for help if you're
#' not clear on how to do this. Be warned, though, that if you assign "File" for
#' some observed data but not all, only the observed data with an assignment for
#' "File" will show up on the graph.
#'
#' One other note: The observed data files from the PE data-entry template don't
#' include the \emph{name} of the compound you're simulating (column:
#' "Compound"). They do include whether it was a substrate, metabolite, or
#' inhibitor (column: CompoundID), but not the compound's actual name. For that
#' reason, try coloring or facetting your data by CompoundID rather than by
#' Compound if you have observed data. Similarly, if you have an inhibitor and
#' you have observed data, the inhibitor will be listed as the generic
#' "inhibitor" here rather than, e.g., "ketoconazole" because the observed data
#' file doesn't indicate that.
#'
#' \strong{Other notes:} There's a bug in RStudio (I think) that sometimes
#' causes the last shape in a legend to vanish when you're looking at the graph
#' in RStudio, but, if you save the graph, the shape \emph{should} be present.
#' Let me know if that doesn't happen. -LSh
#'
#' @param ct_dataframe the input concentration-time data generated by running
#'   the function \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}} or
#'   \code{\link{extractConcTime}}. Not quoted.
#' @param obs_to_sim_assignment optionally specify which observed files should
#'   be compared to which simulator files. If left as NA and what you supplied
#'   for \code{ct_dataframe} doesn't already specify which observed data go with
#'   which simulated file, this will assume that \emph{all} observed data goes
#'   with \emph{all} simulated data. To specify, use a named character vector
#'   like this: \code{obs_to_sim_assignment = c("obs data 1.xlsx" =
#'   "mdz-5mg-qd.xlsx", "obs data 2.xlsx" = "mdz-5mg-qd-cancer.xlsx")} If one
#'   observed file needs to match more than one simulated file but not
#'   \emph{all} the simulated files, you can do that by separating the simulated
#'   files with commas, e.g., \code{obs_to_sim_assignment = c("obs data 1.xlsx"
#'   = "mdz-5mg-qd.xlsx, mdz-5mg-qd-fa08.xlsx", "obs data 2.xlsx" =
#'   "mdz-5mg-qd-cancer.xlsx, mdz-5mg-qd-cancer-fa08.xlsx")}. Pay close
#'   attention to the position of commas and quotes there!
#' @param mean_type plot "arithmetic" (default) or "geometric" mean
#'   concentrations or "median" concentrations as the main (thickest or only)
#'   line for each data set. If this aggregate measure is not available in the
#'   simulator output, you'll receive a warning message and we'll plot one that
#'   \emph{is} available.
#' @param figure_type the type of figure to plot. \describe{
#'
#'   \item{"means only"}{(default) show only the mean, geometric mean, or median
#'   (whatever you chose for "mean_type")}
#'
#'   \item{"percentiles"}{plots an opaque line for the mean data and lighter
#'   lines for the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated data}
#'
#'   \item{"percentile ribbon"}{show an opaque line for the mean data and
#'   transparent shading for the 5th to 95th percentiles. \strong{NOTE: There is
#'   a known bug within RStudio that can cause filled semi-transparent areas
#'   like you get with the "percentile ribbon" figure type to NOT get graphed
#'   for certain versions of RStudio.} To get around this, within RStudio, go to
#'   Tools --> Global Options --> General --> Graphics --> And then set
#'   "Graphics device: backend" to "AGG". Honestly, this is a better option for
#'   higher-quality graphics anyway!}}
#' @param linear_or_log the type of graph to be returned. Options: \describe{
#'   \item{"semi-log"}{y axis is log transformed; this is the default}
#'
#'   \item{"linear"}{no axis transformation}
#'
#'   \item{"both vertical"}{both the linear and the semi-log graphs will be
#'   returned, and graphs are stacked vertically}
#'
#'   \item{"both horizontal"}{both the linear and the semi-log graphs will be
#'   returned, and graphs are stacked horizontally}}
#' @param colorBy_column (optional) the column in \code{ct_dataframe} that
#'   should be used for determining which color lines and/or points will be.
#'   This should be unquoted, e.g., \code{colorBy_column = Tissue}.
#' @param color_labels optionally specify a character vector for how you'd like
#'   the labels for whatever you choose for \code{colorBy_column} to show up in
#'   the legend. For example, use \code{color_labels = c("file 1.xlsx" = "fa
#'   0.5", "file 2.xlsx" = "fa 0.2")} to indicate that "file 1.xlsx" is for an
#'   fa of 0.5 and "file 2.xlsx" is for an fa of 0.2. The order in the legend
#'   will match the order designated here.
#' @param legend_label_color optionally indicate on the legend something
#'   explanatory about what the colors represent. For example, if
#'   \code{colorBy_column = File} and \code{legend_label_color = "Simulations
#'   with various fa values"}, that will make the label above the file names in
#'   the legend more explanatory than just "File". The default is to use
#'   whatever the column name is for \code{colorBy_column}. If you don't want a
#'   label for this legend item, set this to "none".
#' @param color_set the set of colors to use. Options: \describe{
#'
#'   \item{"default"}{a set of colors from Cynthia Brewer et al. from Penn State
#'   that are friendly to those with red-green colorblindness. The first three
#'   colors are green, orange, and purple. This can also be referred to as
#'   "Brewer set 2". If there are only two unique values in the colorBy_column,
#'   then Brewer set 1 will be used since red and blue are still easily
#'   distinguishable but also more aesthetically pleasing than green and
#'   orange.}
#'
#'   \item{"Brewer set 1"}{colors selected from the Brewer palette "set 1". The
#'   first three colors are red, blue, and green.}
#'
#'   \item{"ggplot2 default"}{the default set of colors used in ggplot2 graphs
#'   (ggplot2 is an R package for graphing.)}
#'
#'   \item{"rainbow"}{colors selected from a rainbow palette. The default
#'   palette is limited to something like 6 colors, so if you have more than
#'   that, that's when this palette is most useful. It's \emph{not} very useful
#'   when you only need a couple of colors.}
#'
#'   \item{"blue-green"}{a set of blues fading into greens. This palette can be
#'   especially useful if you are comparing a systematic change in some
#'   continuous variable -- for example, increasing dose or predicting how a
#'   change in intrinsic solubility will affect concentration-time profiles --
#'   because the direction of the trend will be clear.}
#'
#'   \item{"blues"}{a set of blues fading light blue to dark blue. Like
#'   "blue-green", this palette can be especially useful if you are comparing a
#'   systematic change in some continuous variable.}
#'
#'   \item{"Tableau"}{uses the standard Tableau palette; requires the "ggthemes"
#'   package}
#'
#'   \item{"viridis"}{from the eponymous package by Simon Garnier and ranges
#'   colors from purple to blue to green to yellow in a manner that is
#'   "printer-friendly, perceptually uniform and easy to read by those with
#'   colorblindness", according to the package author}
#'
#'   \item{a character vector of colors}{If you'd prefer to set all the colors
#'   yourself to \emph{exactly} the colors you want, you can specify those
#'   colors here. An example of how the syntax should look: \code{color_set =
#'   c("dodgerblue3", "purple", "#D8212D")} or, if you want to specify exactly
#'   which item in \code{colorBy_column} gets which color, you can supply a
#'   named vector. For example, if you're coloring the lines by the compound ID,
#'   you could do this: \code{color_set = c("substrate" = "dodgerblue3",
#'   "inhibitor 1" = "purple", "primary metabolite 1" = "#D8212D")}. If you'd
#'   like help creating a specific gradation of colors, please talk to a member
#'   of the R Working Group about how to do that using
#'   \link{colorRampPalette}.}}
#'
#' @param obs_shape optionally specify what shapes are used to depict observed
#'   data for a) the substrate drug alone and b) the substrate drug in the
#'   presence of a perpetrator. Input should look like this, for example:
#'   \code{c(1, 2)} to get an open circle for the substrate and an open triangle
#'   for the substrate in the presence of perpetrators, if there are any. If you
#'   only specify one value, it will be used for both substrate with and without
#'   perpetrators. To see all the possible shapes and what number corresponds to
#'   which shape, type \code{ggpubr::show_point_shapes()} into the console. If
#'   left as NA, substrate alone will be an open circle and substrate +
#'   inhibitor 1 will be an open triangle.
#' @param obs_size optionally specify the size of the points to use for the
#'   observed data. If left as NA, the size will be 2.
#' @param obs_color optionally specify a color to use for observed data if the
#'   color isn't already mapped to a specific column. By default, observed data
#'   will be the same color as whatever else matches those observed data in
#'   \code{colorBy_column}, so if you have colored by compound ID, for example,
#'   the observed data will also be colored by compound ID. If you have one
#'   observed file that you're comparing to multiple simulation files (this is
#'   what ct_plot_overlay will do if "File" is NA for the observed data), then
#'   the observed data will all be black by default, or you could set that color
#'   to be, say, a lovely purple by setting this: \code{obs_color =
#'   "darkorchid4"}. Hex color codes are also ok to use, and setting this to
#'   "none" will remove observed data from the graph.
#' @param obs_fill_trans optionally specify the transparency for the fill of the
#'   observed data points, which can be helpful when you have a lot of points
#'   overlapping. This only applies when you have specified a value for
#'   \code{obs_color} and when \code{obs_shape} is a shape that has a fill
#'   (example: \code{obs_shape = 21} for a filled circle, which is the default).
#'   Acceptable values are from 0 (fully transparent, so no fill at all) to 1
#'   (completely opaque or black). If left as the default NA, the observed data
#'   points will be 50 percent transparent, so the same as if this were set to
#'   0.5.
#' @param obs_line_trans optionally specify the transparency for the outline of
#'   the observed data points, which can be helpful when you have a lot of
#'   points overlapping. Acceptable values are from 0 (fully transparent, so no
#'   line at all) to 1 (completely opaque or black). If left as the default NA,
#'   the observed data points will be opaque, so the same as if this were set to
#'   1.
#' @param connect_obs_points TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to add
#'   connecting lines between observed data points from the same individual
#' @param obs_on_top TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to show the observed
#'   data on top of the simulated data. If FALSE, the simulated data will be on
#'   top.
#' @param include_errorbars TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include error
#'   bars for observed data points. This ONLY applies when you have supplied
#'   observed data from V22 or higher because those data files included a column
#'   titled "SD/SE", which is what we'll use for determining the error bar
#'   heights.
#' @param errorbar_width width of error bars to use in hours (or, if you've used
#'   some other time unit, in whatever units are in your data). Default is 0.5.
#' @param linetype_column the column in \code{ct_dataframe} that should be used
#'   for determining the line types and also the shapes of the points for
#'   depicting any observed data. For example, if \code{linetype_column} is set
#'   to \code{Inhibitor}, then the default is to show a solid line (simulated
#'   data) and an open circle (observed data) for no inhibitor being present and
#'   then a dashed line (simulated data) and an open triangle (observed data)
#'   when the inhibitor \emph{is} present. You can set which types of lines to
#'   use with the argument \code{linetypes} and you can set which shapes of
#'   points you want with the argument \code{obs_shape}.
#' @param linetype_labels optionally specify a character vector for how you'd
#'   like the labels for whatever you choose for \code{linetype_column} to show
#'   up in the legend. For example, use \code{linetype_labels = c("file 1.xlsx"
#'   = "fa 0.5", "file 2.xlsx" = "fa 0.2")} to indicate that "file 1.xlsx" is
#'   for an fa of 0.5 and "file 2.xlsx" is for an fa of 0.2. The order in the
#'   legend will match the order designated here.
#' @param linetypes the line types to use. Default is "solid" for all lines.
#'   You'll need one line type for each possible value in the column you
#'   specified for \code{linetype_column}. If you get a graph you didn't expect
#'   as far as line types go, try checking what all the possible values are for
#'   the column you specified for \code{linetype_column}. You can do this by
#'   checking, e.g., \code{unique(CT$Inhibitor)} if your ct_dataframe was named
#'   "CT" and the column you set for \code{linetype_column} was "Inhibitor". To
#'   see possible line types by name, please enter
#'   \code{ggpubr::show_line_types()} into the console.
#' @param line_width optionally specify how thick to make the lines. Acceptable
#'   input is a number; the default is 1 for most lines and 0.8 for some, to
#'   give you an idea of where to start.
#' @param line_transparency optionally specify the transparency for the trial
#'   mean or percentile lines. Acceptable values are from 0 (fully transparent,
#'   so no line at all) to 1 (completely opaque or black). If left as the
#'   default NA, this value will be automatically determined.
#' @param legend_label_linetype optionally indicate on the legend something
#'   explanatory about what the line types represent. For example, if
#'   \code{linetype_column = Inhibitor} and \code{legend_label_linetype =
#'   "Inhibitor present"}, that will make the label in the legend above, e.g.,
#'   "none", and whatever perpetrator was present more explanatory than just
#'   "Inhibitor". The default is to use whatever the column name is for
#'   \code{linetype_column}. If you don't want a label for this legend item, set
#'   this to "none".
#' @param facet1_column optionally break up the graph into small multiples; this
#'   specifies the first of up to two columns to break up the data by, and the
#'   designated column name should be unquoted, e.g., \code{facet1_column =
#'   Tissue}. If \code{floating_facet_scale} is FALSE and you haven't specified
#'   \code{facet_ncol} or  \code{facet_nrow}, then \code{facet1_column} will
#'   designate the rows of the output graphs.
#' @param facet1_title optionally specify a title to describe facet 1. This is
#'   ignored if \code{floating_facet_scale} is TRUE or if you have specified
#'   \code{facet_ncol} or \code{facet_nrow}.
#' @param facet2_title optionally specify a title to describe facet 2. This is
#'   ignored if \code{floating_facet_scale} is TRUE or if you have specified
#'   \code{facet_ncol} or \code{facet_nrow}.
#' @param facet2_column optionally break up the graph into small multiples; this
#'   specifies the second of up to two columns to break up the data by, and the
#'   designated column name should be unquoted, e.g., \code{facet2_column =
#'   CompoundID}. If \code{floating_facet_scale} is FALSE and you haven't
#'   specified \code{facet_ncol} or  \code{facet_nrow}, then
#'   \code{facet2_column} will designate the columns of the output graphs.
#' @param facet_ncol optionally specify the number of columns of facetted graphs
#'   you would like to have. This only applies when you have specified a column
#'   for \code{facet1_column} and/or \code{facet2_column}.
#' @param facet_nrow optionally specify the number of rows of facetted graphs
#'   you would like to have. This only applies when you have specified a column
#'   for \code{facet1_column} and/or \code{facet2_column}.
#' @param floating_facet_scale TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to allow the
#'   axes for each facet of a multi-facetted graph to scale freely to best fit
#'   whatever data are present. Default is FALSE, which means that all data will
#'   be on the same scale for easy comparison. However, this could mean that
#'   some graphs have lines that are hard to see, so you can set this to TRUE to
#'   allow the axes to shrink or expand according to what data are present for
#'   that facet. Floating axes comes with a trade-off for the looks of the
#'   graphs, though: Setting this to TRUE does mean that your x axis won't
#'   automatically have pretty breaks that are sensible for times in hours.
#' @param facet_spacing Optionally set the spacing between facets. If left as
#'   NA, a best-guess as to a reasonable amount of space will be used. Units are
#'   "lines", so try, e.g. \code{facet_spacing = 2}. (Reminder: Numeric data
#'   should not be in quotes.)
#' @param time_range time range to display. Options: \describe{
#'
#'   \item{NA}{entire time range of data; default}
#'
#'   \item{a start time and end time in hours}{only data in that time range,
#'   e.g. \code{c(24, 48)}. Note that there are no quotes around numeric data.}
#'
#'   \item{"first dose"}{only the time range of the first dose}
#'
#'   \item{"last dose"}{only the time range of the last dose}
#'
#'   \item{"penultimate dose"}{only the time range of the 2nd-to-last dose,
#'   which can be useful for BID data where the end of the simulation extended
#'   past the dosing interval or data when the substrate was dosed BID and the
#'   perpetrator was dosed QD}
#'
#'   \item{a specific dose number with "dose" or "doses" as the prefix}{the time
#'   range encompassing the requested doses, e.g., \code{time_range = "dose 3"}
#'   for the 3rd dose or \code{time_range = "doses 1 to 4"} for doses 1 to 4}
#'
#'   \item{"all obs" or "all observed" if you feel like spelling it out}{Time
#'   range will be limited to only times when observed data are present.}
#'
#'   \item{"last dose to last observed" or "last obs" for short}{Time range will
#'   be limited to the start of the last dose until the last observed data
#'   point.} }
#'
#' @param x_axis_interval set the x-axis major tick-mark interval. Acceptable
#'   input: any number or leave as NA to accept default values, which are
#'   generally reasonable guesses as to aesthetically pleasing and PK-relevant
#'   intervals.
#' @param x_axis_label optionally supply a character vector or an expression to
#'   use for the x axis label
#' @param pad_x_axis optionally add a smidge of padding to the x axis (default
#'   is TRUE, which includes some generally reasonable padding). If changed to
#'   FALSE, the y axis will be placed right at the beginning of your time range
#'   and all data will end \emph{exactly} at the end of the time range
#'   specified. If you want a \emph{specific} amount of x-axis padding, set this
#'   to a number; the default is \code{c(0.02, 0.04)}, which adds 2\% more space
#'   to the left side and 4\% more space to the right side of the x axis. If you
#'   only specify one number, padding is added to the left side.
#' @param pad_y_axis optionally add a smidge of padding to the y axis (default
#'   is TRUE, which includes some generally reasonable padding). As with
#'   \code{pad_x_axis}, if changed to FALSE, the x axis will be placed right at
#'   the bottom of your data, possibly cutting a point in half. If you want a
#'   \emph{specific} amount of y-axis padding, set this to a number; the default
#'   is \code{c(0.02, 0)}, which adds 2\% more space to the bottom and nothing
#'   to the top of the y axis. If you only specify one number, padding is added
#'   to the bottom.
#' @param y_axis_limits_lin Optionally set the Y axis limits for the linear
#'   plot, e.g., \code{c(10, 1000)}. If left as NA, the Y axis limits for the
#'   linear plot will be automatically selected. This only applies when you have
#'   requested a linear plot with \code{linear_or_log}.
#' @param y_axis_limits_log Optionally set the Y axis limits for the semi-log
#'   plot, e.g., \code{c(10, 1000)}. Values will be rounded down and up,
#'   respectively, to the nearest order of magnitude. If left as NA, the Y axis
#'   limits for the semi-log plot will be automatically selected. This only
#'   applies when you have requested a semi-log plot with \code{linear_or_log}.
#' @param y_axis_interval set the y-axis major tick-mark interval. Acceptable
#'   input: any number or leave as NA to accept default values, which are
#'   generally reasonable guesses as to aesthetically pleasing intervals.
#' @param y_axis_label optionally supply a character vector or an expression to
#'   use for the y axis label
#' @param hline_position numerical position(s) of any horizontal lines to add to
#'   the graph. The default is NA to have no lines, and good syntax if you
#'   \emph{do} want lines would be, for example, \code{hline_position = 10} to
#'   have a horizontal line at 10 ng/mL (or whatever your concentration units
#'   are) or \code{hline_position = c(10, 100, 1000)} to have horizontal lines
#'   at each of those y values. Examples of where this might be useful would be
#'   to indicate a toxicity threshold, a target Cmin, or the lower limit of
#'   quantification for the assay used to generate the concentration-time data.
#' @param hline_style the line color and type to use for any horizontal lines
#'   that you add to the graph with \code{hline_position}. Default is "red
#'   dotted", but any combination of 1) a color in R and 2) a named linetype is
#'   acceptable. Examples: "red dotted", "blue dashed", or "#FFBE33 longdash".
#'   To see all the possible linetypes, type \code{ggpubr::show_line_types()}
#'   into the console.
#' @param vline_position numerical position(s) of any vertical lines to add to
#'   the graph. The default is NA to have no lines, and good syntax if you
#'   \emph{do} want lines would be, for example, \code{vline_position = 12} to
#'   have a vertical line at 12 h or \code{vline_position = seq(from = 0, to =
#'   168, by = 24)} to have horizontal lines every 24 hours for one week.
#'   Examples of where this might be useful would be indicating dosing times or
#'   the time at which some other drug was started or stopped.
#' @param vline_style the line color and type to use for any vertical lines that
#'   you add to the graph with \code{vline_position}. Default is "red dotted",
#'   but any combination of 1) a color in R and 2) a named linetype is
#'   acceptable. Examples: "red dotted", "blue dashed", or "#FFBE33 longdash".
#'   To see all the possible linetypes, type \code{ggpubr::show_line_types()}
#'   into the console.
#' @param graph_labels TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to include labels (A,
#'   B, C, etc.) for each of the small graphs. (Not applicable if only
#'   outputting linear or only semi-log graphs.)
#' @param graph_title optionally specify a title that will be centered across
#'   your graph or set of graphs
#' @param graph_title_size the font size for the graph title if it's included;
#'   default is 14. This also determines the font size of the graph labels.
#' @param legend_position Specify where you want the legend to be. Options are
#'   "left", "right" (default in most scenarios), "bottom", "top", or "none" if
#'   you don't want one at all.
#' @param prettify_compound_names set this to a) TRUE (default) or FALSE for
#'   whether to make the compound names in the legend prettier or b) supply a
#'   named character vector to set it to the exact name you'd prefer to see in
#'   your legend. For example, \code{prettify_compound_names =
#'   c("Sim-Ketoconazole-400 mg QD" = "ketoconazole", "Wks-Drug ABC-low_ka" =
#'   "Drug ABC")} will make those compounds "ketoconazole" and "Drug ABC" in a
#'   legend, and \code{prettify_compound_names = TRUE} will make some reasonable
#'   guesses about what a prettier compound name should be. An example of
#'   setting this to TRUE: "SV-Rifampicin-MD" would become "rifampicin", and
#'   "Sim-Ketoconazole-200 mg BID" would become "ketoconazole".
#' @param qc_graph TRUE or FALSE (default) on whether to create a second copy of
#'   the graph where the left panel shows the original graph and the right panel
#'   shows information about the simulation trial design. This works MUCH faster
#'   when you have already used \code{\link{extractExpDetails_mult}} to get
#'   information about how your simulation or simulations were set up and supply
#'   that object to the argument \code{existing_exp_details}.
#' @param existing_exp_details output from \code{\link{extractExpDetails}} or
#'   \code{\link{extractExpDetails_mult}} to be used with \code{qc_graph}
#' @param save_graph optionally save the output graph by supplying a file name
#'   in quotes here, e.g., "My conc time graph.png"or "My conc time graph.docx".
#'   The nice thing about saving to Word is that the figure title and caption
#'   text will be partly filled in automatically, although you should check that
#'   the text makes sense in light of your exact graph. If you leave off ".png"
#'   or ".docx", it will be saved as a png file, but if you specify a different
#'   graphical file extension, it will be saved as that file format. Acceptable
#'   graphical file extensions are "eps", "ps", "jpeg", "jpg", "tiff", "png",
#'   "bmp", or "svg". Do not include any slashes, dollar signs, or periods in
#'   the file name. Leaving this as NA means the file will not be automatically
#'   saved to disk.
